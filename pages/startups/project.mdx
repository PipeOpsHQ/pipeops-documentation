# Overview

Deploying your applications on your clusters created with PipeOps is a breeze. We have designed the process to be easy and seamless, ensuring a smooth experience for you.

## Getting Started

Many companies initially opt for a PaaS solution due to its simplicity and ease of use. However, as they scale and encounter technical and economic constraints, they often need to migrate away from the PaaS model. One common challenge they face is finding the right balance between speed and flexibility.

PipeOps bridges this gap by offering the best of both worlds. It not only provides the simplicity and ease of use of a PaaS but also allows you to create and manage your own infrastructure. With PipeOps, you have the flexibility to deploy and manage your applications on your preferred infrastructure, eliminating the risk of vendor lock-in. Whether you choose to leverage PipeOps' infrastructure or bring your own, you have full control over your environment, enabling you to tailor it to your specific needs
