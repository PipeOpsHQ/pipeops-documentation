## Rust On PipeOps

PipeOps is the ideal platform for deploying your Rust applications due to its robust support. As you read on, you'll discover just how effortless it is to deploy your project.

## Getting Started

For a quick and hassle-free start, you can clone our pre-built Rust template from [here](https://github.com/pipeops-dev/pipeops-rust). This template comes with a Dockerfile that will be used during deployment. However, if you already have a project to deploy, you'll need to create a Dockerfile and copy the relevant information from our Rust template Dockerfile into your project's Dockerfile.

Here's an example Dockerfile based on our Rust template:

```
# Use a Rust base image
FROM rust:latest as build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files to the container
COPY Cargo.toml ./

# Create an empty project with the same dependencies to cache them
RUN mkdir src && \
    echo "fn main() {println!(\"if you see this, the build broke\")}" > src/main.rs && \
    cargo build --release && \
    rm -f target/release/deps/pipeops-rust*

# Copy the rest of the source code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the Rust application
RUN cargo build --release

# Create a smaller final image
FROM debian:buster-slim

# Set the working directory in the final image
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built application from the build image to the final image
COPY --from=build /app/target/release/pipeops-rust .

# Expose the port your Rust web application listens on (change as needed)
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run your Rust web application (adjust as needed)
CMD ["./pipeops-rust"]

```
## Deploy Your Project

We assume that you've gone through our get started guide. If not, you can access it [here](https://docs.pipeops.io/developers). Once you've gone through the guide, you can proceed to connect your PipeOps account to your preferred git provider and select your project. In the image below, you'll find the necessary configurations for your Rust project. After completing these configurations, you can click on the "Deploy Project" button to deploy your project.
