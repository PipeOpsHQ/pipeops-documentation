Cloud servers are virtual servers that are hosted and maintained by cloud computing providers like Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure., rather than being located in a physical data center. They provide the computing power and storage capacity needed to run applications and store data over the internet and can be easily accessed and managed via the cloud provider's web-based interface or API.
