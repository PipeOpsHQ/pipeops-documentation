Now that your project is publicly accessible on your preferred domain, you can focus on making updates and further developing it. PipeOps makes this process easy with automatic deployments, which allow you to continuously deploy new code updates without any additional effort on your part. Simply push your code changes to your Git repository and PipeOps will handle the rest, including building and deploying your updated application. This streamlined workflow allows you to focus on developing and improving your application, rather than worrying about the technical details of deployment.

By default, PipeOps will deploy every commit pushed to the Git repository connected to your project, regardless of the branch, as long as it is connected to a Git repository and you deployed to `production` not `Beta`.

While automatic deployments can be convenient, you may want to have more control over when and how your code updates are deployed. To disable automatic deployments, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your project in the PipeOps dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Source Control" section.
3. Check the "Manual Deploy" option.

By changing this setting, you can manually trigger deployments whenever you are ready to release new code updates. This can be useful if you want to perform additional testing or review before deploying, or if you simply want more control over the deployment process.
