Welcome your visitors to a personalized, branded experience by assigning a custom domain to your project. A custom domain allows you to use a domain name that is specific to your brand, rather than a generic URL provided by PipeOps. This can help to immediately convey to your visitors that they have arrived at the correct destination and build trust in your brand.

## Default Domain

By default, every newly created Project will automatically be granted its own subdomain that gets assigned to Production Deployments, ending in `antqube.io`.

You can find it right below your Project's name on the Project list:

This default Domain is free of charge forever and is auto-generated for your project.

If you want to, it can forever remain on your Project and be the main way in which visitors access your application (or you might choose to keep it for some time, and then remove it at some point in the future).

You can also edit your default domain name to any name that suits you.

## Custom Domain

To use a custom domain name instead of the default subdomain provided by PipeOps, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Settings" tab of your project in the PipeOps dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "General Settings" section.
3. Follow the prompts to add your desired custom domain name.

By configuring your own domain in this way, you can provide a more personalized and branded experience for your visitors.

If you don't own one yet, make sure to purchase it first.
