### Step 1: Verify Project Structure
Before you begin troubleshooting, it's essential to ensure that your project adheres to the expected directory structure and contains the necessary configuration files. These commonly include manifest.yml, Dockerfile, Procfile, or buildpacks.toml. Proper configuration is vital. For detailed information on configuring your application, please refer to our [guide](https://pipeops.io/resources/guides).



### Step 2: Check Buildpack Configuration
Review your project's configuration files to confirm that you have correctly specified the appropriate buildpack. Accurate selection of the buildpack is critical for a successful deployment. To determine which buildpack is suitable for your application, consult our [documentation](https://docs.pipeops.io/support).



### Step 3: Update Buildpacks selection
If the specified buildpack is unavailable or incompatible with your application, it's necessary to update your configuration to use a supported buildpack. You may also need to adjust your application to accommodate the required buildpack.


### Step 4: Test Locally
Before proceeding with deployment, rigorously test your application on your local environment. This step will help you identify and rectify any code or dependency issues.


### Step 5: Deploy To PipeOps
Once you've ensured that your application functions correctly locally and have configured the appropriate buildpack settings, you can proceed with deploying your application to PipeOps.
