# Welcome to PipeOps

Welcome to the PipeOps documentation. PipeOps is a powerful No-code Tool for Cloud Deployments & Infrastructure Management. With PipeOps, you can easily set up and manage your cloud infrastructure, providing a seamless experience for deploying your applications.


## Why Choose PipeOps?

Many companies initially opt for a PaaS solution for its simplicity and ease of use. However, as they scale, technical and economic constraints often push them to migrate away from the PaaS. The trade-off between speed and flexibility becomes a challenge.

PipeOps bridges this gap by offering the best of both worlds. It brings the simplicity of a PaaS while allowing you to maintain full control over your infrastructure. With PipeOps, you can easily deploy and manage your applications on your own infrastructure without vendor lock-in.
